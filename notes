How do I parse through python code that's being written on a web app?
Since it's an interpreted language, should I just run the code like every second
or two? Would that be extremely heavy? Well, let's just try it.

Okay. Editor: Ace editor.

Starting with tabs vs. spaces. Detect if there are inconsistencies in the
tabs/spaces that the user is typing in.

What's a super simple example?
x = 11/4
if (x == 2.75):
    print(x)
else:
    print("Int/int doesn't work")

Look for the error in which they're looking to compare a float to what might
look like another float, but really isn't because and int divided by an int
doesn't give you float.
